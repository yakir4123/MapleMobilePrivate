# MapleMobile
I believe almost every developer start develop because he wanted to create his own game,
 than he or she understand that's not that easy than just knowing how to program.
 What stops me every time was that I didn't know how to draw animations for every even the most basic game,
 Plus if I wanted to create a real game I need to learn how to use a game engine like unity which is
 boring because most of the real programming is already done...
